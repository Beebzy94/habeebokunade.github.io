              that it can grow the business by capturing new clients who build
              trust with the organization. In the long run, clients build a
              strong relationship with a brand that has a strong identity that

              The aim was to create a strong combination mark with text and the
              use of a mountain vector image. The letter A was replaced with the
              mountain to form a strong combination mark that represents what
              the client was looking to achieve.
